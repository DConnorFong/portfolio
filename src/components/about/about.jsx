                <p>
                    Since beginning studies in engineering at the University of British Columbia in 2015, I have been avidly programming.
                    I specialize in full-stack web applications and am fascinated with designing software that is elegantly simple for both the user and maintainer.
                    With 8 months experience in freelance and a 12 months as a co-op developer, I look forward to tackling new challenges every day.
